1.0.1
* Fixed compile error regarding function `to_pointer` when C++20 is used.
  Call to `to_address` must be fully qualified, i.e. `SFL_DTL::to_address`.
  If call is not fully qualified then compiler somehow cannot decide between
  `std::to_address` and `SFL_DTL::to_address`.
* Improved tests. Testing with different allocators. Several allocators are
  designed specially for tests. One of allocators uses fancy pointers.

1.0.0 (2022-03-17)
* Fancy pointers revisited. Using pointer traits `to_address` and `to_pointer`.
* Started semantic versioning (see https://semver.org).
* Added file VERSION.txt.

2022-03-13-1
* `static_assert` must have message in C++11.

2022-03-13
* Added pointer trait `to_address`. Added support for fancy pointers.
* Updating tests.
* Added file CHANGELOG.txt.

2022-02-24
* Fixed `swap` member functions. Old member functions could create memory leaks
  in case of exceptions.
